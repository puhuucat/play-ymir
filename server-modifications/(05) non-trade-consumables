â€¢ Add non-tradeable versions of all all necessary consumables
(ex. Elite Siege Box I - comes with a corresponding - [NT] Elite Siege Box I)
 - [NT] versions are non-tradeable and non-droppable, including their contents if they come in boxes/packages
 - They are account-bound and can only be transferred between characters within the same account
